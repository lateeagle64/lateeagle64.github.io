You are serving a life sentence for various crimes you probably committed.
You may select your first and last name. Your actions influence the story and outcome.

Daily routine in your cell:

Time: 6:00 AM (Wake Up)
Location: Your Cell

It's time for the prisoners to wake up. Your cellmate Albert Smith has a 75% chance of being awake. He can be interacted with to buy things or to talk. His trust level
is based on how often you interact positively with him, with stealing or insulting him lowering it. His trust level dictates how willing he is to help you out with things. Your reputation
will go up if you interact positively with people, and goes up more if you give them things. If you give people controband, your malice level will go up, making the guards more likely to search
you which they do randomly based on your malice level. They have a chance of searching you after any action in the cafeteria, or at yard time. (1% chance)

There's a 15% chance a guard is outside your cell, who you can bribe with money for items. 

You can search your cell, exercise in your prison (your fitness improves your chance of winning a fight), bribe a guard, or you can read (your intelligence improves your chance of being able to
successfully bribe a guard or other inmate). You have 30 minutes before breakfast starts. You may do 2 things within that time before breakfast.

Time: 7:00 AM (Breakfast)
Location: Cafeteria

You and the other inmates enter the cafeteria for breakfast. Depending on the day, there are different food options that give different amounts of energy and improves your 
food level differently (The more you eat the more strength you gain from exercise)

Breakfast Menu:

Monday: Scrambled Eggs and sausages (20% energy and 20% food) or Bologna sandwich and a boiled egg (25% energy and 30% food)
Tuesday: Bacon and Toast (25% energy and 25% food) or Oats and Yogurt (20% energy and 30% food)
Wednesday: Chocolate Pudding and crackers (35% energy and 40% food) or Sloppy Joe and french fries (40% energy and 35% food)
Thursday: Spaghetti with meatballs (30% energy and 30% food) or Mac and cheese and applesauce (35% energy and 20% food)
Friday: Ham and cheese sandwich (25% energy and 25% food) or Rice and gravy (20% energy and 30% food)

After eating, you may interact with 2-10 other inmates or guards for bribes or chats (The number of inmates you can interact with depends on your current social standing)
Your reputation depends how much people hate you, and they will be less likely to be nice to you if you are a bad person.

You can search the trash 2-5 times for items (Purely luck, due to there being guards around)

40% chance of trash or nothing useful
25% chance for scraps you can craft with
20% chance for money (0.5 dollars that exponentially increases with chance and stuff idk)
10% chance for a lockpick (2 uses)\
5% chance for a keycard

When done with stuff, you will return to your cell

Time: 8:30 AM (Yard Time)

You have time outside to exercise, interact with other inmates or guards, search the trash, or plot to escape. With a keycard, you can attempt to escape the prison with a low chance
(Your chance can be improved depending on your energy and ability to run or fight guards pursuing you. You may need weapons and more things. You can also craft a rope to stealthily escape.
You can interact with 5-25 people depending on your reputation.

Time: 11:00 AM (Lunch)

You and the other inmates enter the cafeteria for lunch (similar to breakfast)

Lunch Menu:

Monday: Meatloaf and mashed potatoes (35% energy and 30% food)
Tuesday: Beef tacos (35% energy and 35% food)
Wednesday: Chili and cornbread (35% energy and 40% food)
Thursday: Spaghetti and meatballs (40% energy and 35% food)
Friday: Pizza (50% energy and 40% food)

You can interact with 5-15 inmates and search the trash 4-7 times

Time: 12:30 PM (Free time)

You can go to your cell and sleep until dinner, go to the yard, or explore the prison for a chance to escape. Pretty much
yard time but you can go anywhere

Time: 6:30 PM (Dinner)

Breakfast menu, but the days are shifted one up, so monday food becomes friday, and tuesday becomes monday.
Same as breakfast, except you can search the trash 3-7 times

Time: 8:00 PM (Lockdown)

You and the other inmates go back to your cells, and have to stay there. You can sleep early, or do the same things as wake up. There is a 25% chance a guard is outside of your cell.
You and your cell mate can try and escape by digging out. Everyday, your progress increases. You wont get caught if a guard isn't near your cell. If there is a guard outside your cell,
You have a 45% chance of getting caught and getting put in solitary. After you get out, your hole will be fixed and your progress will be reset. When you get to 100%, you escape in the dark.
You must have 85% energy or more to run out. You can do 3 things during lockdown.

Time: 10:00 PM (Lights out)

You can either read, or go to sleep. Same as lights out but if you get caught doing anything else but sleeping, you will be yelled at and embarrassed, and your reputation will go down. 
You can choose 2 things, sleep, read, or exercise. If you only read, or only exercise, you will wake up with less energy.
